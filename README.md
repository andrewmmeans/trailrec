# Rec & Ride
## Recommender system for mountain bike trails

There are over 75,000 mountain bike trails in the US & Canada ridden by 7 million people annually. Trail organizations and volunteers have contributed detailed information about each trail on websites like Trailforks.com. However, there is an information overload: crowded map views and never-ending lists make it difficult to find trails you want to ride when you travel or are planning a bike trip.


Rec & Ride attacks this problem in two ways. Users can enter the name of one of their favorite trails, and receive recommendations for similar trails to ride, which are based on the trail features. If they already are an active user of Trailforks.com who records their rides on the app, they can enter their username and receive recommendations that are crowdsources from the activity of other users.
